  title = {Optimal designs for rational models and weighted polynomial regression},
  journal = {Annals of Statistics},
  volume = {27},
  pages = {1272--1293},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {In this paper $D$-optimal designs for the weighted polynomial regression
	model of degree $p$ with efficiency function $(1 + x^2)^{-n}$ are
	presented. Interest in these designs stems from the fact that they
	are equivalent to locally $D$-optimal designs for inverse quadratic
	polynomial models. For the unrestricted design space $\mathbb{R}$
	and $p < n$, the $D$-optimal designs put equal masses on $p + 1$
	points which coincide with the zeros of an ultraspherical polynomial,
	while for $p = n$ they are equivalent to $D$-optimal designs for
	certain trigonometric regression models and exhibit all the curious
	and interesting features of those designs. For the restricted design
	space $[1, 1]$ sufficient, but not necessary, conditions for the
	$D$-optimal designs to be based on $p + 1$ points are developed.
	In this case the problem of constructing ($p + 1$)-point $D$-optimal
	designs is equivalent to an eigenvalue problem and the designs can
	be found numerically. For $n = 1$ and 2, the problem is solved analytically
	and, specifically, the $D$-optimal designs put equal masses at the
	points $\pm 1$ and at the $p - 1$ zeros of a sum of $n + 1$ ultraspherical
	polynomials. A conjecture which extends these analytical results
	to cases with $n$ an integer greater than 2 is given and is examined
	empirically.},

  journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {18},

  abstract = {Parameter estimation is generally based upon the maximum likelihood
	approach and often involves regularization. Typically it is desired
	that the results be unbiased and of minimum variance. However, it
	is often better to accept biased estimates that have minimum mean
	square error. Bayesian inference is an attractive approach that achieves
	this goal and incorporates regularization automatically. More importantly,
	it permits us to analyse experiments in which both the system response
	and the independent variables (time, sensor position, experimental
	conditions, etc) are corrupted by noise and in which the model includes
	nuisance variables. This paper describes the use of Bayesian inference
	for an apparently simple experiment which is, in fact, fundamentally
	difficult and is compounded by a nuisance variable. By presenting
	this analysis we hope that members of the inverse community will
	see the value of applying Bayesian inference.},

	experiments},
  journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {17},
  pages = {1895},
  number = {7},
  abstract = {An important concern in the design of validation experiments is how
	to incorporate the mathematical model in the design in order to allow
	conclusive comparisons of model prediction with experimental output
	in model assessment. The classical experimental design methods are
	more suitable for phenomena discovery and may result in a subjective,
	expensive, time-consuming and ineffective design that may adversely
	impact these comparisons. In this paper, an integrated Bayesian cross-entropy
	methodology is proposed to perform the optimal design of validation
	experiments incorporating the computational model. The expected cross
	entropy, an information-theoretic distance between the distributions
	of model prediction and experimental observation, is defined as a
	utility function to measure the similarity of two distributions.
	A simulated annealing algorithm is used to find optimal values of
	input variables through minimizing or maximizing the expected cross
	entropy. The measured data after testing with the optimum input values
	are used to update the distribution of the experimental output using
	Bayes theorem. The procedure is repeated to adaptively design the
	required number of experiments for model assessment, each time ensuring
	that the experiment provides effective comparison for validation.
	The methodology is illustrated for the optimal design of validation
	experiments for a three-leg bolted joint structure and a composite
	helicopter rotor hub component.},

  pages = {145--157},
  abstract = {When Shannon entropy is used as a criterion in the optimal design
	of experiments, advantage can be taken of the classical identity
	representing the joint entropy of parameters and observations as
	the sum of the marginal entropy of the observations and the preposterior
	conditional entropy of the parameters. Following previous work in
	which this idea was used in spatial sampling, the method is applied
	to standard parameterized Bayesian optimal experimental design. Under
	suitable conditions, which include non-linear as well as linear regression
	models, it is shown in a few steps that maximizing the marginal entropy
	of the sample is equivalent to minimizing the preposterior entropy,
	the usual Bayesian criterion, thus avoiding the use of conditional
	distributions. It is shown using this marginal formulation that under
	normality assumptions every standard model which has a two-point
	prior distribution on the parameters gives an optimal design supported
	on a single point. Other results include a new asymptotic formula
	which applies as the error variance is large and bounds on support
	size.},
