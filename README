Paper to be submitted (hopefully) to Measurement Science and Technology.

Unless, of course, if I find a better fitting journal for this. But have to
write it first anyways....

If going to MST, should target "Technical design notes" category. From the
description at http://iopscience.iop.org/0957-0233/page/Scope
"Brief contributions on current design, development and application work;
not normally more than 2500 words (3 journal pages), including descriptions
of apparatus or techniques developed for a specific purpose, important
experimental or theoretical points and novel technical solutions to commonly
encountered problems."

(This is because not sure if I could force it into the "Paper" category:
"Reports of original research work; Papers on new instruments should
include some representative results. Claims for originality of instrument
design or novelty of measurement technique should be clearly stated in the
abstract.")
